*The compiler of a functional language*

</div>

Current work on this compiler is focused primarily on low-level language features. Developments of a standard library and other luxuries will be implemented at a later date.

## WARNING

This compiler is not ready for general use.

Significant lifting is done by pointers within generated code, these are treated as 64-bit integers. If this is a problem for anyone, I'm very curious as to why. :slight_smile:
